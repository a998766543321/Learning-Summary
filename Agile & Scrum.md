# Agile Manifesto 

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

# Agile Principals
1. Our highest priority is to **satisfy the customer** through early and **continuous delivery** of valuable software.

2. Welcome **changing requirements**, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3. **Deliver working software frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the **shorter timescale**.

4. **Business** people and developers must **work together daily** throughout the project.

5. Build projects around **motivated individuals**. Give them the **environment** and support they need and trust them to get the job done.

6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face** conversation.

7. **Working software** is the primary **measure of progress**.

8. Agile processes promote **sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers,  and users should be able to maintain a **constant pace** indefinitely.

9. Continuous attention to **technical excellence** and good design enhances agility.

10. **Simplicity**--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.

12. At regular intervals, the team **reflects** on how to become more effective, then tunes and **adjusts** its behavior accordingly.


# The Three Pillars of Empiricism
1. Transparency
    - We all know what is going on
2. Inspection
    - Check your work as you do it
    - is not an inspection by an inspector or an  auditor but an inspection by every- one on the Scrum Team
    - For example, the team openly and transparently shows the product at the end of each Sprint to the  customer in order to gather valuable feedback.
3. Adaptation
    - OK to change tactical direction

# Scrum
  - is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

# The Scrum Values
1. Commitment
    - People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team
2. Focus
    - Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team
3. Openness
    - The Scrum Team and its stakeholers agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work
4. Respect
    - Scrum Team members respoect each other to be capable, independent people
5. Courage
    - Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems


# The Scrum Team
- Scrum Teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necessary to create value each Sprint.
- One product owner
- One scrum master
- typically 10 or fewer people
- multiple cohesive Scrum Teams share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner
- Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable, useful Increment every Sprint

# The Scrum Team Members
1. Product Owner
    - Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal
    - Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items
    - Ordering Product Backlog items
    - Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood
2. Developers
    - **Any member of a Scrum Team**, that is committed to creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint **regardless of technical, functional or other specialty**.
    - Creating **a plan for the Sprint**, the **Sprint Backlog**
3. Scrum Master
    - accountable for guiding, coaching, teaching and assisting a Scrum Team and its environments in a proper understanding and use of Scrum
    - Ensuring that all Scrum events take place and are positive, productive, and kept within the timebox.
    - true leaders who serve the Scrum Team and the larger organization


# Scrum Events
## Sprint
  - **1 to 4 weeks per month**
  - the longer the sprint, the higher the risk is
  - A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint
  - Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned
  - forecast progress, like **burn-downs,  burn-ups, or cumulative flows**

## Sprint Planning
  - **8 hours per month**
  - collaborative work of the **entire Scrum Team**
  - The **Product Owner** ensures that attendees are prepared to discuss the most important Product Backlog items
  - The **Sprint Goal** must be finalized prior to the end of Sprint Planning.
  - The **Developers** select items from the Product Backlog to include in the current Sprint.
  - For each selected Product Backlog item, the **Developers** plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done.
  - **Create a sprint goal** then added to the Sprint Backlog

## Daily Scrum
  - **15-minute** event for the **Developers** of the Scrum Team
  - held at the **same time and place every working day**
    - The consistency reduces complexity.
  - inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work
  - The Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan.
  - Daily Scrum is NOT a status meeting.

## Sprint Review
  - **4 hours per month**
  - **inspect the outcome** of the Sprint and **determine future adaptations**
  - the **Scrum Team and stakeholders** review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment
  - The **Product Backlog may also be adjusted** to meet new opportunities.
  - The **Developers demonstrate** the work that it has “Done”
  - Result: defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint planning

## Sprint Retrospective
  - **3 hours per month**
  - plan ways to **increase quality and effectiveness**
  - **The Scrum Team** inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their Definition of Done
  - The Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint.
  - They may even be **added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint**.
  - Although improvements may be implemented at any time
  - provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation

# Scrum Artifacts
- Scrum’s artifacts represent work or value.
- Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured

## Product Backlog
  - **Commitment: Product goal**
    - Product Goal describes a **future state of the product**
  - Contains the product goal
  - Ordered list of what is needed to improve the product
  - Multiple Scrum Teams often work together on the same product. One Product Backlog is used to describe the upcoming work on the product.
  - Single source of work from the product owner

## Sprint Backlog
  - **Commitment: Sprint goal**
  - Contains a sprint plan + selected items from the product backlog + at least one high priority Retrospective improvement works
  - Answer the three questions:
    - Why (Sprint Goal)
    - What (The set of  Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint)
    - How (Actionable plan for delivering the Increment)
  - **planned by and for the Developers**
  - Owned by and only changed by the developers
  

## Increment
  - **Commitment: Definition of Done**
  - workable software
  - concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal
  - Increment(s) may be delivered to stakeholders prior to the end of the Sprint
  - The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.
  - creates transparency by providing everyone a shared understanding of what work was completed as part of the  Increment.
  - When many Scrum Teams are working on a single product, **All Scrum Teams must have a Definition of Done that makes their combined Increment valuable and useful.**


# Scrum Key Terms

## Product goal
  - describes a future state of the product
  - The Product Goal is in the  Product Backlog

## Sprint Goal
  - describes the business purpose and value of the sprint
  - There are times when a sprint goal might be multifaceted, for example, “Get basic printing working and support search by date.”

## Sprint Termination
  - Product owners is responsible for cancelling the sprint when the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete

## User stories
  - format for expressing the desired business value for many types of product backlog items, especially features.
  - 3C (Card size, conversation, and confirmation)
  - is not a part of scrum
  - main focus is not writing a detailed requirement but only just enough text to remind the requirements from the users
  - the size should be small less than 48 hrs works
  
## Product Backlog Refinement (Grooming)
  - Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate on the details of Product Backlog items

## Definition of done
  - It is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the  quality measures required for the product. The moment a Product Backlog item meets the Definition of Done, an Increment is born.
  - The definition of done evolves over time is that the team will discover weaknesses or gaps in their definition of done over the course of their work.
  - A product backlog item can be considered done only when both the item-specific acceptance criteria and the sprint level definition-of-done items have been met.

## Velocity
  - Velocity is the amount of work completed each sprint.
  - measured by adding the sizes of the PBIs that are completed by the end of the sprint. A PBI is either done or it’s not done.
  - helps determine its capacity to commit to work during the upcoming sprint.
  - is also a diagnostic metric that the team can use to evaluate and improve its use of Scrum to deliver customer value.
