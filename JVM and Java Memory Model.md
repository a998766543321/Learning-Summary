Java has **2** such environments and everyone working with Java has to start their work after setting up one of these environments on their local development or production environment platforms

* JRE (Java Runtime Environment): the minimum environment needed for running a Java application (no support for developing). It includes JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and deployment tools.
* JDK (Java Development Kit): the complete development environment used for developing and executing Java applications. It includes both JRE and development tools.
