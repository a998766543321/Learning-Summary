# IoC containers
- The Spring Framework's IoC container core is defined in two packages: 
1. org.springframework.beans and org.springframework.context.BeanFactory (org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory) 
2. ApplicationContext (org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext) are two important interfaces that provide a basis for IoC containers.

## BeanFactory
- provides the configuration framework and basic functionality and takes care of bean instantiation and wiring

## ApplicationContext
- ApplicationContext can also take care of bean instantiation and wiring
